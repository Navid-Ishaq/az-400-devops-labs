## üìò **Scenario: Improving Team Collaboration and Code Quality in a Growing Startup**

**Meet Elena**, a software engineer at a fast-growing e-commerce startup called **QuickKart**. The company has recently expanded its engineering team, and code management has become chaotic. Developers are working on different versions of code, bugs are creeping into production, and no one knows who changed what or why.

Elena's CTO tasks her with **setting up a professional version control system** that supports:

* **Team collaboration**
* **Code traceability**
* **Branching and merging best practices**
* **Policy-based code reviews**

Elena decides to use **Azure DevOps** and **Git** to bring structure and discipline to the development workflow.

---

## üîß **Step-by-Step Journey: How Elena Solves the Problem**

### üîπ **Step 1: Create an Azure DevOps Organization**

Elena creates an **Azure DevOps organization** for QuickKart so the team can centralize their project workflows. This acts as their **collaboration hub** ‚Äî developers, testers, and project managers can now work in a shared space.

### üîπ **Step 2: Configure Git & VS Code**

She sets up **Git** on her machine and configures **Visual Studio Code** for development. By setting her **Git credentials**, she ensures every commit is properly tagged with the author's identity ‚Äî critical for **audit trails** and **accountability**.

### üîπ **Step 3: Create a Team Project**

Elena creates a new project called **eShopOnWeb** and selects the **Scrum process** so that future work items can be tracked in sprints. This aligns the development team with **agile methodologies**.

### üîπ **Step 4: Import the Codebase**

She imports a sample .NET app from GitHub to give her team a jumpstart. This allows her to demonstrate how to work with **existing codebases** and adopt Azure DevOps seamlessly into their current workflow.

### üîπ **Step 5: Clone and Modify the Repo**

Elena clones the repo into her local system using **Visual Studio Code**. She edits a file, adds a comment, and commits it with a clear message. By doing this, she shows how **developers can work independently** and still maintain **version control**.

### üîπ **Step 6: Push Changes & Sync**

She uses the **Synchronize Changes** feature to push her updates to the central repository. This allows others on her team to **pull the latest code** and avoid conflicts ‚Äî reducing errors in production.

### üîπ **Step 7: Branching for Safety**

Elena creates a **dev branch** to isolate her feature work. This ensures that the **main branch remains stable** while she experiments. She later deletes and restores branches to demonstrate flexibility in managing **short-lived feature branches**.

### üîπ **Step 8: Enforce Branch Policies**

To improve quality, Elena applies **branch policies**: requiring at least one reviewer and linking commits to work items. This ensures that **every change is reviewed and traceable to a business need** ‚Äî no more mystery bugs!

### üîπ **Step 9: Pull Request and Code Review**

She edits the code in the **dev** branch and opens a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge it into **main**. Azure DevOps reminds her that a **work item must be linked**, reinforcing good habits like **documentation and traceability**.

She links the work item, completes a self-review, and merges the PR. Now every change is:

* Reviewed
* Tracked
* Documented

### üîπ **Step 10: Use Tags for Versioning**

Elena tags the current codebase as **v1.1.0-beta**, preparing it for a **beta release**. This helps the QA team and business users **test specific versions** without confusion about which code is deployed.

---

## üéØ **Outcome: A Professional, Scalable DevOps Workflow**

By the end of her setup:

* QuickKart‚Äôs developers work confidently using **branches and commits**
* Reviewers know exactly **what code was changed and why**
* Business stakeholders can track **feature progress** via linked work items
* The codebase is **stable, traceable, and secure**

The tools Elena used‚Äî**Azure DevOps, Azure Repos, Git, VS Code, Pull Requests, Tags, Branch Policies**‚Äîaren‚Äôt just for labs; they are real-world tools used by high-performing teams to ship quality software, fast.

---

**This lab simulates Elena‚Äôs journey.**
And now, **you** can apply the same principles to your projects ‚Äî whether you're managing a small app or a full-scale enterprise product.
